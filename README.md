# Fonstes_Alternativas_Equalizador
Simulação e projeto de um equalizador de tensão.

It was my primary cientific iniciation on eletrical engineering and the work can be adjust relation to this citation and correction in 
writing, and in Technical  way there is a great job to do, that i wasn't make due to my inexperienced in microcontrollers.

Each of those equalizer topology have to has one ways of keys that make the system to be more efficiently, and it necessity to make some 
study of ways to switch each topology, what make necessary a use of microcontroler to take the voltage of ultracapacitors and 
make a choice of the better way of switch each topology.

Making this simulations, and including the voltage equalizer that is proposed on the work, it turns on a great job, serving to be themes
of others great job.

Each topology in the work can be sending for me just asking me on a email : fabiano.marino@usp.br
